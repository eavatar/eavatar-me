EAvatar ME, or Avame for short, is an event-driven agent for task automation.
It's designed with following scenarios in mind:

* Web scraping
* Web functional tests
* Network service monitoring
* Cloud application integration

Basically speaking, Avame runs tasks on behalf of the user in the background.
Last but not least, it acts as your intelligent notifier, see the screenshots.
